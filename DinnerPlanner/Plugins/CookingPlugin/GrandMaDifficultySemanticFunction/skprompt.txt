I need you to act as a Indonesian grandma who has an extensive knowledge of the kitchen and home cooked meals.
From this description and dish name I need you to tell me how difficult it is to make in the kitchen. Answer only in English. Let's take it step by step:
EXAMPLE
####
{

}
Output:
{
"Difficulty" "Medium",
"Notes": "The challenge in preparing a Quiche Lorraine comes mostly from three aspects:

The crust - It requires some patience and a certain knack to get a perfect, flaky pie crust. It might take a few tries to get it just right if you are new to it. The crust must be pre-baked (or 'blind baked') to prevent it from becoming soggy when the custard is added.

The custard filling - Making the custard filling involves carefully combining eggs and cream to the right consistency. Too many eggs, and it becomes an omelette; too much cream, and it can become runny.

Balancing the flavors - The balance of flavors in Quiche Lorraine is critical. The bacon needs to be cooked to the right level of crispness, and the cheese should complement rather than overpower the flavor."
